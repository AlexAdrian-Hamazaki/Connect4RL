# Connect4RL

This repo holds code for a multi-agent RL model for playing connect4 that is trained on curriculum learning

I primarly have used this project to learn the API and HPO framework used by AgileRL. For this purpose I closely followed this tutorial ![here](https://docs.agilerl.com/en/latest/tutorials/pettingzoo/dqn.html#what-is-dqn)
